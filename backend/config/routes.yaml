# yaml-language-server: $schema=../vendor/symfony/routing/Loader/schema/routing.schema.json

# This file is the entry point to configure the routes of your app.
# Methods with the #[Route] attribute are automatically imported.
# See also https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html

# To list all registered routes, run the following command:
#   bin/console debug:router

# Load controller routes FIRST to ensure they take priority over API Platform
controllers:
    resource:
        path: ../src/Controller/
        namespace: App\Controller
    type: attribute

# API Platform routes loaded after controller routes
api_platform:
    resource: .
    type: api_platform
    prefix: /api
